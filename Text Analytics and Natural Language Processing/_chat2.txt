-What is an appropriate gift (business or professional context) in your home country?  What monetary value is the norm to ensure that one is being respectful and appropriate in their spending on a gift? And when does a gift become a bribe?

-What are your top organizational/corporate values for companies you work for or partner with? Why? Have you ever worked for an organization where there was a misalignment with your value, or you felt your values were compromised? How has this changed during COVID?

-This is Prof Cari’s reply when I clarified about that question.
[9/30/21, 5:10:54 PM] ‪+1 (408) 439‑7815‬: Ok
[9/30/21, 5:11:27 PM] ‪+1 (408) 439‑7815‬: The first question had some sub questions. Does anybody have it ?
[9/30/21, 5:12:58 PM] ‪+63 917 571 1219‬: -Is it something you are born into?
-Were you encouraged to make mistakes and try again?
-Were grades/marks important?
-Growing up, what leaders did you admire and why?

I am sorry I was not able to include it.

Good morning to you all!☀️

Today is the voting day, the day you could register your voices and simplify your Hult journey. 

I hope that we all are excited and curious to know our Hult Student Associate who will make this journey even more simpler and efficient also, I anticipate that you all have decided whom to vote as your Hult leader by now. Frankly, for me the important thing is to have our voices heard, to make campus a better place to work and network at. 

Its a kind request for you all to participate in today's voting session.

Thank you everyone.

```Have a wonderful day!```

Hey code masters 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾, my buddy Mallek from MSDI is making a reservation in this bar arcade for tomorrow 🎉 🎉 🎉. I thought it’d be a good idea to go and celebrate our future As in Data fundamentals. Please feel free to join. The idea is to get to know each other in another aspect that’s not just studying 📖 💃🏽🕺🏾.

[10/24/21, 2:52:09 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Weird because he was 100% coughing etc when he was in class with us
[10/24/21, 2:52:18 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Strange Hult wouldn’t make us get tested
[10/24/21, 2:52:52 PM] ‪+1 (786) 438‑8011‬: I don´t think so. He tested positive today, and we see him last on wednesday. In my country you are consider a contact when you where with a positive covid case 48 hours before the positive result or 48 before the symptoms appeared, without the mask. And we were all using mask also so I wouldn´t worry :)

[10/24/21, 2:58:13 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: They just put us in dangerous
[10/24/21, 3:02:53 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: I will ask the Sendy or Morgan to send us all an email of the detailed guidelines to be more clear on this aspect, feel free to reach out to me or @593993950626 for any concerns.

[10/24/21, 3:04:22 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: But reach out to Mauricio first before not coming stating the issue as attendance is one of the Visa requirement
[10/24/21, 3:07:34 PM] ‪+39 335 624 0012‬: Don’t think attending from home would be an issue in this case right? I mean they suggest it in a sense
[10/24/21, 3:08:12 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Hence why he suggested to speak to Mauricio first
[10/24/21, 3:10:06 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: We can just sue Hult if they still put us in danger.

[10/24/21, 3:12:06 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: I know it. But I said if they still put us in danger.
[10/24/21, 3:12:21 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: Now there is a case.
[10/24/21, 3:12:29 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: No one is putting you in danger apart from yourself - it’s your decision to come in or not
[10/24/21, 3:12:37 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: And if you don’t feel safe you let them know and study online
[10/24/21, 3:13:08 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: ?   I told them before.  Do you what did they tell me?
[10/24/21, 3:13:13 PM] ‪+39 335 624 0012‬: Sorry man I’m not catching up ahah
I mean why should we contact mauricio if they tell us it’s ok to attend from home?
[10/24/21, 3:13:26 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Just for attendance purposes
[10/24/21, 3:13:45 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: It takes 1 min to send an email saying ‘hi, I’m gunna study from home becuse of x,y,z’

[10/24/21, 3:21:09 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: @919920392935 thx for asking to school:)
[10/24/21, 3:21:11 PM] ‪+1 (415) 605‑8858‬: Question. If attendance is taken via the myHult how would it matter where we are? 

I suppose that’s how the virtual students are doing it. With respect to this situation, professor himself has allowed us to join from home via zoom. I guess that counts as an exclusion to the mandatory in person attendance rule. 

In any case let’s wait for @919920392935 and HULT to get back to us.
[10/24/21, 3:22:01 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: Is that only this R studio or all corse like data analytics?
[10/24/21, 3:22:10 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: R
[10/24/21, 3:22:26 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: Yes, we all will be informed in-class tomorrow or by an email before that. I have requested Hult to direct an email to all of us
[10/24/21, 3:22:53 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: For now, only for Data Science: R
[10/24/21, 3:23:34 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: I think all teacher should take a test will be safer.  I saw they ate lunch together
[10/24/21, 3:24:08 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: It's our responsibility. Pleasure assisting entire MBAN cohort with such issues.

[10/24/21, 3:27:20 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: I completely understand!
[10/24/21, 3:29:42 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: @919920392935 I Just originally thought school did not care this case.  I think school strongly issues the actions then everything is great.    I appreciate. : )
[10/24/21, 3:31:40 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: Yes, as it was bring forward with Prof. Kurnicki a while back and as its weekend thatswhy, I guess there is a delay but they will get back to us at the earliest I think
[10/24/21, 3:33:14 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: @919920392935 hope professor Kurnicki is ok. He is a great teacher. If he needs help plz let me know.
[10/24/21, 3:34:20 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: Yes, I hope the same too. As per the email, he is stable with no symptoms but just Positive result and he is vaccinated too so, I think he should be fine soon
[10/24/21, 3:41:19 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: Be safe and enjoy the rain!
[10/24/21, 3:47:33 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: You too. Thanks for your service and hope everything will go fine.
[10/24/21, 3:56:41 PM] ‪+234 809 511 1113‬: If the prof has been vaccinated fully and tested positive, this tells you something about the vaccine. HULT’s plan is to get everyone vaccinated before the end of Nov. I think the entire MBAN cohort should get tested.
[10/24/21, 3:57:37 PM] ‪+234 809 511 1113‬: Go get tested whether you are vaccinated or not!
[10/24/21, 3:59:57 PM] ‪+1 (206) 294‑9401‬: Yes! Agree! That’s how I think!
[10/24/21, 4:00:18 PM] ‪+1 (206) 294‑9401‬: The Covid test in CVS cost $25!!!
[10/24/21, 4:00:35 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Ridiculous price aha, is there anywhere for free
[10/24/21, 4:00:54 PM] ‪+1 (206) 294‑9401‬: I think school maybe should provide us free a test….
[10/24/21, 4:03:06 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: That would be nice
[10/24/21, 4:03:49 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: I think so too. That is necessary. Thanks Buhari
[10/24/21, 4:04:17 PM] ‪+234 809 511 1113‬: There are places where you can get tested free.

[10/24/21, 4:06:54 PM] ‪+1 (669) 254‑7929‬: There is a quick test  in cvs $20 a box and test two times. I think it is better.
[10/24/21, 4:07:23 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Well if there is a free one then great
[10/24/21, 4:14:45 PM] ‪+1 (408) 439‑7815‬: Our insurance covers covid tests at cvs or Walgreens
[10/24/21, 4:19:10 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: How can we activate that - just make a claim?
[10/24/21, 4:19:49 PM] ‪+1 (408) 439‑7815‬: When you go to CVS website and try to book an appointment for covid testing
[10/24/21, 4:20:07 PM] ‪+1 (408) 439‑7815‬: It asks for your medical insurance number and other insurance related info
[10/24/21, 4:20:28 PM] ‪+91 96191 05625‬: @Alex - insurance doesn't cover the box tests. Only the tests by appointment at either Walgreens or CVS. You need to upfront give your BCBS insurance number.

[11/8/21, 2:24:39 PM] ‪+1 (617) 682‑5329‬: @491715630568 yeah I think is a mistake, the larger the variation or s in the explanatory variable (x), the smaller the se(b1). Because when you plot X vs Y and you have more points (+variation) you can have a better equation so your error is smaller

[11/9/21, 12:11:31 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: This code will also clean up the ? Marks , instead of writing the gsub variable name by variable name. This will run through the entire data set and clean replace all ? With na. And we can then use na.omit to take out the na
[11/9/21, 12:14:26 PM] ‪+1 (224) 628‑6536‬: does it clear characters?
[11/9/21, 12:16:44 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: Only clean NA
[11/9/21, 12:16:47 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Yes it clears characters. where are characters that are not na. use common_na_strings( inside the naniar package) as a variable and then where you have na .strings replace it with the common na strings.
[11/9/21, 12:17:05 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Replaces any unknown character with na.
[11/9/21, 12:17:16 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: And then you can clean the na after.
[11/9/21, 12:17:49 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: All characters or only the "?"
[11/9/21, 12:19:07 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: All characters. But you have to call the common_na_ strings  before using

[11/9/21, 12:19:45 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: Amazing
[11/9/21, 12:19:54 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: So where you have na.strings= common_na_ strings.
[11/9/21, 12:20:58 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: You must call the Library (naniar) before you can see the common_na_strings. Common_na_numbers
[11/9/21, 12:20:59 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: Did you create the common_na_strings library?
[11/9/21, 12:21:01 PM] ‪+1 (415) 962‑6684‬: Great
[11/9/21, 12:21:33 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: It's under Library ( naniar ).
[11/9/21, 12:22:16 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Install the package.  Then use the function and replace it with "?" In the code
[11/9/21, 12:22:28 PM] ‪+1 (224) 628‑6536‬: na.strings=" ?" considers ? as na or something?
[11/9/21, 12:22:31 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: Is it possible to add more special cha?
[11/9/21, 12:23:04 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Yes. Considers it as character.
[11/9/21, 12:23:46 PM] ‪+1 (224) 628‑6536‬: greaattt
[11/9/21, 12:23:48 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Yes. But you wouldn't need to if you use the na.strings= common_na_strings
[11/9/21, 12:24:07 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: It's covers any character that is a missing value and that is not na

[11/9/21, 12:26:15 PM] ‪+1 (415) 605‑8858‬: Would you use in inside the gsub function?
[11/9/21, 12:26:56 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: No

[11/9/21, 12:28:01 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: It replaces any character that is a missing value with na.

[11/9/21, 12:28:22 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Then after you can use na.omit( ) to take out the na
[11/9/21, 12:28:48 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: You can check that all na is gone with complete.cases() or you use is.na()
[11/9/21, 12:29:19 PM] ‪+1 (224) 628‑6536‬: so do you put all the unwanted characters in a vector and then use na.strings on it ? am i right?
[11/9/21, 12:29:21 PM] ‪+1 (415) 605‑8858‬: Makes sense. This is good code 👍🏼
[11/9/21, 12:30:12 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: Is it possible to replace the na value with the mode for all empty values ​​instead of removing them?
[11/9/21, 12:30:23 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Correct. You do it while reading the entire data so you don't have to start looking column by column
[11/9/21, 12:31:10 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: I think that works also. But taking out a few variables out of large data sets wouldn't make a lot of difference.
[11/9/21, 12:31:19 PM] ‪+234 802 606 9839‬: Easier to just omit all na
[11/9/21, 12:31:52 PM] ‪+51 996 212 127‬: Ik, but sometimes you just can't delete data

Next Tuesday at 18:00 PDT / 21:00 EST we will have a GitHub workshop to understand how teams can collaborate seamlessly within the same code base. Imagine not having to share your code through WhatsApp for your group projects anymore! We'll go over the fundamentals of Git and use GitHub to foster that collaboration. Attendees who participate in the final competition will get a certificate and can win prizes from the official GitHub store!

Hope to see you all there! 👾

some comic relief, for to compensate for the last hour.
[11/16/21, 5:32:31 PM] ‪+33 7 49 45 33 25‬: Is the class disorganised because of the professor or because of the people in the room according to you?
[11/16/21, 5:32:51 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Professor has to take control
[11/16/21, 5:32:52 PM] ‪+34 628 63 51 12‬: Hi! if you are in team 3 in the afternoon class please text me
[11/16/21, 5:33:12 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Its no fault of the class because the class has no idea whats going on
[11/16/21, 5:33:21 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: thats what causes the noise
[11/16/21, 5:33:32 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: because they can understand better from their team mates than the professor herself
[11/16/21, 5:33:45 PM] ‪+49 171 5630568‬: +1
[11/16/21, 5:34:03 PM] ‪+49 171 5630568‬: It feels like trial and error for the professor herself
[11/16/21, 5:34:41 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: I mean im speaking for myself, but im sure others can share this opinion
[11/16/21, 5:34:41 PM] ‪+1 (415) 941‑9656‬: yes please
[11/16/21, 5:34:44 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: yeah exactly, like are we just going to have two-three weeks of dragging and dropping variables around tableau?
[11/16/21, 5:34:45 PM] ‪+49 171 5630568‬: I would like to have a business case working towards an actual goal during one class not throwing random variables in rows and columns
[11/16/21, 5:35:33 PM] ‪+1 (813) 952‑4271‬: I agree 
She needs to take charge and she's also a first year professor at hult and I think they just threw her in

[11/16/21, 5:46:09 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: And then make us&canada a bar chart
[11/16/21, 5:46:14 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: And budget a line graph
[11/16/21, 5:46:29 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: and use number of records as size for all

[11/16/21, 7:15:05 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Just to clarify the past 30 mins of class, the observations are not divided 50/50 because it only focuses on budget - right?
[11/16/21, 7:17:16 PM] ‪+57 316 4505819‬: They are, cuz the split is in the median and the box is the inter quartile range that has the Q1 value and the Q3 value, the line (median) is Q2
[11/16/21, 7:17:48 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Yes, but not in terms of "observations" - doesnt "observations" relate to the indivudal movie titles
[11/16/21, 7:17:55 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: ?^
[11/16/21, 7:18:16 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: It would be the median of budget, not observations
[11/16/21, 7:18:39 PM] ‪+57 316 4505819‬: As we are grouping then into genre we will habe the same analysis for each genre, thats why the box plots are different
[11/16/21, 7:19:17 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Ok let me rephrase my question - she said observations are divded above and below the median line. However, what does she mean by "observations"
[11/16/21, 7:19:21 PM] ‪+57 316 4505819‬: The median of budget for each genre, that is base in the number of observations for each genre
[11/16/21, 7:20:01 PM] ‪+57 316 4505819‬: Number of movies for each genre, and each observation (movie) has its own budget
[11/16/21, 7:20:15 PM] ‪+57 316 4505819‬: So each budget count as an observation
[11/16/21, 7:21:38 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: so our "observations" are not the points on the graph, rather the budget value of the points?
[11/16/21, 7:27:35 PM] ‪+57 316 4505819‬: The points represent the value of the budget for each observation (movie) for each genre (plot)

Just ensure you submit the practice code and you will receive the maximum pre class points. Since it is a do-along video, there are no questions and hence it doesn’t show submitted. Thomas will manually check if code is submitted and give you points!

[11/19/21, 3:15:19 PM] ‪+47 932 88 841‬: DTM sparsity?
- The higher the sparsity, the easier it is to classify based on terms. DTMs are good for classification models
DTMs are the ultimate matrix for the classification models
‎[11/19/21, 3:15:23 PM] ‪+33 7 49 45 33 25‬: ‎image omitted
[11/19/21, 3:15:51 PM] ‪+1 (628) 276‑2267‬: *DTM - how does it work?*
Each row represents one document 
Each column represents one term/ token (word) 
Each value typically contains the number of appearances of that term in that document 

The higher the sparsity, the easier it is to classify based on terms. DTMs are the ultimate for classification models.

Here is a list of things I’ve tried:

- Install httpuv and openssl packages

- Try installing the devtools package that calls the base64enc package but then I get an error stating I need to install a newer version of the same package, which coincidentally is dependent on having the latest version of R. But I already have the latest version of R. I am supposed to run this line of code in conjunction with this package, but this too threw the same error >> # devtools::install_github("jrowen/twitteR", ref = "oauth_httr_1_0")

- Regenerate my API keys and tokens – clear the R memory and start again. I did this twice already.

- Tried switching between accents and double quotes whilst savings my keys and tokens – makes no difference

[11/22/21, 7:10:14 PM] ‪+91 99203 92935‬: MBAN students can approach either one of HSAs, to let us know about their concerns or the issues they are facing. We can then, talk to the the concerned faculties accordingly
[11/22/21, 7:28:45 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: Unfortunately Shlok, despite your efforts, I do not beleive these opinions or voices are being heard. Rather than going through HSA, a townhall would be a much more efficient way of on-campus staff knowing students issues and formulating a plan of action from this. It worked very well in london and doesn’t put added stress on the HSAs
[11/22/21, 7:33:32 PM] ‪+1 (951) 816‑1138‬: I would be down for a town hall. There are a lot of things to be addressed too. (Wi-Fi not working, not knowing future course schedules, class structure/pace, etc.)

As response to multiple discussions about the course Data Visualisation it seems like a good idea to try and get a more objective perspective on the topic. For that purpose this brief survey was created. We want everyone to get the most out of their experience at Hult and hope that you can help us to achieve that with your contribution. Your responses will be treated with confidentiality.

I was just talking to Thomas now and checking with him if he could push the final assignment date to 15th or so ... He said he can do it but needs to talk to academic team. I feel if we all collectively ask for an extension he might give one extra day
