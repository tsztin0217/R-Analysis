In the data set that has to be submitted today looks like some of us might get Multiple regression which wasn't covered in class. If you do get that can you please submit and retake - Mauricio said that it is a system issue and he will create a new attempt just for people who got multiple regression.

Hey code masters 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾, my buddy Mallek from MSDI is making a reservation in this bar arcade for tomorrow 🎉 🎉 🎉. I thought it’d be a good idea to go and celebrate our future As in Data fundamentals. Please feel free to join. The idea is to get to know each other in another aspect that’s not just studying 📖 💃🏽🕺🏾.

[11/4/21, 11:57:50 AM] ‪+1 (628) 688‑2465‬: HSA would it be possible to request when we will receive our marks that are outstanding? Seems a bit long, so would be nice to get an idea of when we can expect them. Especially with so many deadlines up ahead. Would be nice to know what we did well or what needs improvement.
[11/4/21, 12:07:53 PM] ‪+971 52 862 7997‬: Good Morning Tayla,
Erica @33749453325 , and I would ask around to see if we can quicken the grading process or, better still, find out why there’s a delay.
No need to worry; I’m super sure we all did well 👍🏾
[11/4/21, 12:19:26 PM] ‪+1 (628) 688‑2465‬: I appreciate your confidence 😂🙏🏼
[11/4/21, 12:19:54 PM] ‪+961 3 007 088‬: It is common for that to happen on this campus and with Nabanita. The reason is beacause there is a dual corrector, so the TA will go over all exams and correct them afyer the prof has done so to go through all the excels we submitted formula by formula. Considering that the TA is the same for both cohorts that could be why they are late with "data fundamental" course. If possible i eould recommend you focus on the grades from the classes we have now under the reason of"needing to know what we did wrong before the final"
[11/4/21, 12:22:49 PM] ‪+1 (628) 688‑2465‬: I understand all of this but a bit of pressure never hurt. And if the reasoning is because of staff they should look into hiring more staff in order to meet deadlines
[11/4/21, 12:24:13 PM] ‪+961 3 007 088‬: I beat my head against that wall all of last year 😂😂😂 some courses we didnt get the grade until after 1month (2other courses started and finished in the mean time 😂)
[11/4/21, 12:24:58 PM] ‪+961 3 007 088‬: Their famous answer: "we understand and thank you for bringing this up to our attention. We will work on it,"
[11/4/21, 12:34:20 PM] ‪+1 (628) 688‑2465‬: Remind me of this excuse next time we’re late for attendance 😅
[11/4/21, 12:35:38 PM] ‪+961 3 007 088‬: Right!! I wrote them a 1page email depicting how this new system is not in the bemefit of the students, and only "alleviates the workload of TAs at the expense of students"

[11/4/21, 12:45:56 PM] ‪+961 3 007 088‬: They just delay it until our degrees are done.
[11/4/21, 12:47:11 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: Well, you would have a degree done then, wouldn't you?

Seems like everyone wins lol
[11/4/21, 12:49:18 PM] ‪+971 52 862 7997‬: Thank you, Kevin, for the clarification, but be on the safer side and confirm this, @33749453325 and I would still ask.

Thank you

[11/4/21, 1:15:59 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: Im not sure what it means, a bit vague
[11/4/21, 1:16:26 PM] ‪+1 (925) 350‑1383‬: No I don't have it
[11/4/21, 1:16:59 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: It’s an outstanding task on myHult
[11/4/21, 1:17:17 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: I signed it on orientation day but seems it didn’t go through
[11/4/21, 1:17:41 PM] ‪+1 (925) 350‑1383‬: Ah okay I remember now what it was
[11/4/21, 1:17:49 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: I didn't consent to their protection of my interests
[11/4/21, 1:17:58 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: But did they give info about it in orientation? Lol
[11/4/21, 1:18:06 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: Because this is news to me
[11/4/21, 1:20:50 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: No they just made us sign before entering the building lol
[11/4/21, 1:20:59 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: Yo, what lao
[11/4/21, 1:21:00 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: Lmao
[11/4/21, 1:22:43 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: Yeah but if they put a finance hold they won’t give you the diploma
Im still fighting with the London campus to get mine bc they apparently put an admissions hold on mine I didn’t know about
[11/4/21, 1:23:53 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: That is hectic
[11/4/21, 1:24:25 PM] ‪+34 680 14 10 16‬: 6 months to get a master, over 3 months to get them to agree to give me my diploma lol
[11/4/21, 1:31:09 PM] ‪+44 7411 404300‬: Maybe the real diploma was the friends made along the way 🥲
[11/4/21, 1:49:52 PM] ‪+44 7427 415911‬: You're onto something here, Kenneth. These days, people you know are likelier to get you the job than a paper diploma 😂
[11/4/21, 3:30:06 PM] ‪+1 (628) 688‑2465‬: On another note- have we heard anything more about Prf Thomas’ after hours today? Is it straight after class? Or online later?
[11/4/21, 3:32:50 PM] ‪+44 7500 175311‬: I think straight after class?? Anyone else know?
[11/4/21, 3:35:20 PM] ‪+961 3 007 088‬: I think its the 5pm workshop right?

[11/8/21, 2:55:45 PM] ‪+91 96191 05625‬: Yes for exam! We can use the formula sheet
[11/8/21, 2:55:48 PM] ‪+91 96191 05625‬: The Final Exam will cover all the content of this course. 

You will have about 100 minutes to take this exam (TBC).
The exam is based on a multiple-choice questions format.
We will include a calculator embedded in the exam. You can bring your own calculator. Any calculator model is fine as long as it does not have the ability to communicate or transfer data.  A basic calculator should be fine. 
No use of excel during the exam. We won't give you any files to work with - 
You may not use any external resources. Opening another application such as Excel, Internet, PDF, etc. will be considered a violation of the exam and may incur grade penalties in addition to any penalty that the Academic Committee determines.

You may print the cheat sheet with formulas, which can be found in the modules section. Feel free to edit that sheet. ONLY bring ONE or MAXIMUM TWO sheets of paper, printed on one or both sides.  If you bring two sheets of paper, they may be stapled at all times. 

You will be provided a z-table, a t-statistic table, and a chi-sq. table. We will include it inside the exam.

All students (with emphasis on our zoom friends):

You must take this exam on your own, with no outside help. Do not communicate anything about the exam, even if you have completed your test.
You must have your camera and video on during ALL OF THE TIME of the exam and your entire face should be visible at all times.

CONGRATS!  I'm very proud of you for finishing your final coding exam! You are one step closer to becoming an amazing data scientist. 

As we take our break between classes (almost a week), I would like to ask you to complete a new DataCamp track called: Shiny Fundamentals with R. If you don't have time to complete the entire track - I suggest that you at least complete the "Building Dashboards with shinydashboards" course - which is within that track. As we saw in today's class, Shiny apps are a great way to make your audience addicted to your work! 

I've added this "Shiny Fundamentals with R" track to your DataCamp accounts - so that you can take it for free. (the due date is 11/15 @ 11:59pm) 

Keep coding and have fun! Rrrrrr!!

Next Tuesday at 18:00 PDT / 21:00 EST we will have a GitHub workshop to understand how teams can collaborate seamlessly within the same code base. Imagine not having to share your code through WhatsApp for your group projects anymore! We'll go over the fundamentals of Git and use GitHub to foster that collaboration. Attendees who participate in the final competition will get a certificate and can win prizes from the official GitHub store!

Hope to see you all there! 👾

As response to multiple discussions about the course Data Visualisation it seems like a good idea to try and get a more objective perspective on the topic. For that purpose this brief survey was created. We want everyone to get the most out of their experience at Hult and hope that you can help us to achieve that with your contribution. Your responses will be treated with confidentiality.
