# Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
For this assignment, I was asked to find an area of interest, collect  and analyze text data in R using at least 2 frameworks covered in class. (Examples of accepted "framework": N-grams, sentiment analysis, tf-idf, correlograms, classification with Bayes, LDA, .etc ). <br>
## Business Objective:
As a graduate student, my time was limited and I often missed some of the frequent chat notifications from my cohort. I am now using this opportunity to conduct a text-based analysis to determine if the contents within those conversations require my closer attention on a daily basis.
